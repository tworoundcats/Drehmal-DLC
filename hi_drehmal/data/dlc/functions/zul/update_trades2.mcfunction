Some sources suggest that she took her own life, unable to cope with the eternal blizzard."}', '{"text":"Greatbeast Muhs,\\nAspect of Beasts\\n-------------------\\nThe deceased Greatbeast was reviled by many mortals during his life for his more hostile creations. His detractors would eventually catch up to him, killing him in his mossy den beneath the Heartwood."}', '{"text":"Mari the Great,\\nAspect of Drehmari\\n-------------------\\nWhile not directly or solely responsible for the creation of Drehmari, Mari remains a symbol of the race\'s culture and spirituality in Sahd. The only known being to have glimpsed the fabled Arc of Twilight. "}', '{"text":"Abominate Maen,\\nAspect of Pain\\n-------------------\\nSon of Khive, exiled to Loruhn for his murder of the Tempest. While quick to anger and capable of great cruelty, he is also responsible for managing the flow of pain, a task he begrudingly carries out on the high moon."}', '{"text":"Kind-Wyrm Moen,\\nAspect of Pleasure\\n-------------------\\nKhive\'s daughter is a widely beloved Aspect with deep ties to the La\'Tehrmari clergy and state.
