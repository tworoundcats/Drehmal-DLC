He is worshipped most fiercely in Western Merijool, where many copies of his chromatic Sacred Flame still burn today."}', '{"text":"Glacial Elder Loe, Aspect of Cold\\n-------------------\\nLoe is not in the best of spirits these days, but who could blame her? The state of her holy site is truly appalling, even if the amount of cold has expanded over time. Coupled with what\'s happened in her domain, though? Awful."}', '{"text":"Life-Bringer Vayniklah, Aspect of Life\\n-------------------\\nDearest Vayniklah carries the weight of her followers\' actions with her in every breath she takes.

She has shown minimal remorse for her role in the family\'s fracture."}', '{"text":"Fluvial Dahroehl, Aspect of Freshwater\\n-------------------\\nSpawn of Dahr, Dahroehl is a vain and brooding Aspect worshipped for his creation of water sources for mortals. She maintains strong followings in the western desert and modern Tehrmia."}', '{"text":"Tempest Palaesida, Aspect of Storms\\n-------------------\\nCentral to the Divine Schism and Frostfang Catastrophe, Palaesida now finds himself in an eternal state of unrest. With a perpetual storm whipping around his bones, he ensures that none who let him die will know peace."}', '{"text":"Wise Worm Koh, \\nAspect of Stone\\n-------------------\\nSuggested to be responsible for all of Drehmal\'s tunnels and caves, Koh maintains a strong following in the crystal-infested twin isles of the northwest. Perhaps it is responsible for that very plague."}', '{"text":"Summit-Drake Nahyn, Aspect of Mountains\\n-------------------\\nSmall but mighty, Nahyn is much more important than one might initially think. Whereas Taihgel\'s other offspring is reclusive, Nahyn reaches up to grace the skies with his creations, and has played host to major powers in his domain."}', '{"text":"Zephyr Rihalae, \\nAspect of Wind\\n-------------------\\nRihalae is the daughter of Rihelma, taking the Star-Rise Drake\'s most free-spirited tendencies. Her nomadic ways inspire mortal followers to go wherever the wind may take them.

Some sources suggest that she took her own life, unable to cope with the eternal blizzard."}', '{"text":"Greatbeast Muhs,\\nAspect of Beasts\\n-------------------\\nThe deceased Greatbeast was reviled by many mortals during his life for his more hostile creations. His detractors would eventually catch up to him, killing him in his mossy den beneath the Heartwood."}', '{"text":"Mari the Great,\\nAspect of Drehmari\\n-------------------\\nWhile not directly or solely responsible for the creation of Drehmari, Mari remains a symbol of the race\'s culture and spirituality in Sahd. The only known being to have glimpsed the fabled Arc of Twilight. "}', '{"text":"Abominate Maen,\\nAspect of Pain\\n-------------------\\nSon of Khive, exiled to Loruhn for his murder of the Tempest. While quick to anger and capable of great cruelty, he is also responsible for managing the flow of pain, a task he begrudingly carries out on the high moon."}', '{"text":"Kind-Wyrm Moen,\\nAspect of Pleasure\\n-------------------\\nKhive\'s daughter is a widely beloved Aspect with deep ties to the La\'Tehrmari clergy and state. Also seen as responsible for love, kindness, and many recreational activities.

They find themselves trapped in Nothing for their benevolence."}', '{"text":"Lahrs, the Burgeoning, Aspect of Resonance\\n-------------------\\nLahrs is... something else.
